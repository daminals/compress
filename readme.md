# Storing all my handy-dandy shell script commands

It's nice to work quickly

### Compress

I used this ffmpeg command a lot, quick and dirty way to speed compressing videos by only including the important bits

### Logs

Just a faster way to check my logs

### Save

Automatically commits (and allows me to set a commit message) and runs through any remote and automatically pushes.

# How do you do this for yourself?
Make a folder in your root called bin and throw your scripts there. Then you can use them anywhere in your computer without even having to use ./
